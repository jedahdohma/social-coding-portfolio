## Revisiting Experiences:
###### It took me so long to figure out what to process through Python because I didn't find it appropriate to measure how many times the word b*tch is said in Breaking Bad. 
###### Additionally, I couldn't even get my hands on all the screenplays.
###### There were only around **four** available and the series has *a lot* of episodes.
###### Ultimately, I decided to work with one of my all-time favorite movies, Jurassic Park (1993).
------
## Initial Assumptions:
###### Man, not gonna lie. I thought this was gonna be much easier.
###### Choosing something good for data analysis is TUFF. T-U-F-F!
###### I didn't want to be a quitter and simply focus on **ONE** episode of Breaking Bad.
###### I think I redeemed myself with a film's script.

------
## Solving Problems:
###### The names of characters certainly appear a lot throughout the script. Of course, a character like Ellie Sattler isn't just _any_ character, she's one of the ***main*** characters.
###### Once I got rid of character names and other boringly common words, I was able to see what appeared on the script wth frequency.
