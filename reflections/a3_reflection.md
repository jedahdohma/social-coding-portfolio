## Revisiting Experiences:
###### Out of all the activities I have done so far, this one gave me a little headache.
###### I had to go back to Melanie Walsh's site and read it.
------
## Initial Assumptions:
###### I thought it was going to be a bit simpler.
###### I kind of felt like a fool while I was trying to figure it out.
###### But at least I felt glad when I managed to figure it out.

------
## Solving Problems:
###### This was a tough nut to crack. I had to look over my books on Python (that I still haven't returned! Don't tell them!!!)
###### I seriously couldn't figure out what to tell Python to do.
###### I had to do that thing where I have to think about what I want it to do
###### Then I figure out if there are any commands I can use
