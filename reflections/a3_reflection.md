- this was a tough nut to crack, i had to look over my borrowed python books (that i still haven't returned, don't tell them!!!)
- i had to do that thing where i have to think about what i want it to do and then i'll figure out if there are any commmands/bits i can write to make it do what i intend it to do
- this was mildly depressing but i understand the need
