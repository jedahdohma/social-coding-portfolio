## Revisiting Experiences:
###### I had to remember the differences between the integer and string stuff.
###### Gladly remembered how to combine stuff, which was a relief.
###### Then i kind of forgot how .lower() and .strip() worked, so i needed a refresher
------
## Initial Assumptions:
###### You can't write stuff without having it be a code (turns out you can make it so)

------
## Solving Problems:
###### Totally forgot you can print a data type. But then I looked through previous readings
###### I think I know how input works by now. became acquainted when I made a little program thing
