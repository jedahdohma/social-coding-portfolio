- had to remember the differences between the integer and string stuff
- gladly remembered how to combine stuff, which was a relief
- but then i kind of forgot how .lower() and .strip() worked, so i needed a refresher
- also totally forgot you can print a data type. but then i looked through previous readings
- you can write stuff without having it be a code
- i think i know for sure how input works by now. became acquainted when i made a little program thing
- had to read that f string reading but it was done....
